To Do
=====

- Clean up seeders/figure out where to talk about/make sure I understand them well
- Make sure I understand the way the new auth helpers work
    + maybe not, maybe just do it from scratch to help people understand
    + if so, probably skip it in the overview, rely on the feature portion
- Read up on events and queues and mail
- Break the app up into logical checkpoints
